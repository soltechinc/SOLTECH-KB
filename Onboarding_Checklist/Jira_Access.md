# Jira System Access

Jira is SOLTECH's main system for project management and time tracking.

## Getting Started

You should have received an email or printout with your Jira credentials. If not, please get with your on-boarding mentor to expedite that set-up.

1. Navigate to [jira.soltech.net] and you will see the standard login screen. (below)

Here you can also change your password, profile avatar, etc.

1. Search By Projects

![Project List](./assets/Jira/jira-project-list.png)

All SOLTECH projects are broken down into either Software- or Business-type projects. You can go to a list of each type to search generally for a particular project by entering the Project name or key into the search box at the top of the page.

Alternatively, if you have the project key already, you can navigate to `http://jira.soltech.net/projects/{project-key}` - with the appropriate key - and view the project directly.

1. Search by Issue

![Issue Navigator](./assets/Jira/jira-issue-navigator.png)

The Issue Navigator works similarly to the Project List but with more advanced filters available. There common filters available on the left-hand side menu or you can define your own. Any filter that you set for a search can be saved and recalled again later.
