# How to Track and Submit Your Time in Tempo on Jira

Tempo is a timekeeping module in Jira, which we use to track and bill time to client accounts. To access it, you will need to have a Jira account set up. (navigate here for more info on Jira access)

The expectation is that you will use Tempo to account for your time daily, across the week (starting from Monday,) with annotations of what your work entailed. At the end of the week (or the following Monday, at the latest,) You will post that week's timesheet to an approver that's responsible for the projects or tasks which you billed time to.
